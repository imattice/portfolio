<h2 class='title'>Ike!</h2>

<p class='about_me'>
    I am a level 4 Technomancer who enjoys creating fun things using internet magic.
    While I am still a novice, I am a commited learner and have a sharp wit, so no problem is too intimidating to tackle.
    Coming from a background of Philosophy, I am used to reading the arcane and making sense of large tomes of complex logic.

<p class='about_me'>Oh!  And I also like cooking, playing video games, and puppies.</p>
